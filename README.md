# Decoding-Baseball-Signs
<h3>This is a project that decodes baseball and accurately guesses (haha my jokes are hilarious) if it is a steal ot no steal. Idea has been ripped off from Mark Robers video.</h3>

This normally uses the machine learning approach but as mentioned in the video to which the link can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmlRbfSavbI) most coaches use
the method of indicator and an aftersign to which cracking is easy with an algorithm.

Docs coming soon
